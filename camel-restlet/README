This is a sample camel-restlet component project. It uses a Restlet API (http://www.restlet.org/) to serve.

Restlet API allows you to run ReST service without a container and hence the reason for choosing Restlet.
Note: Restlet is not jax-rs complaint yet, they have road map to achieve this using a extension.

Note: I couldn't find ways to automatically wire payload to the Restlet engine for it invoke right methods. Hence
this sample does a manual mapping of payload to methods.

Steps to run the project
