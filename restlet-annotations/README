This project is an demonstration of Java Annotations API. The project defines a few annotations that are used
in camel-restlet application. Annotations generally are used by frameworks to generate source code, but this sample
project is built for source code validation i.e. to check annotations defined and flag them as errors if inappropriate.

Java 6 and above as Annotations Processor API that defines a set of rules on how annotations are processed. A standard
way is to put the annotations processor class in javax.annotation.processing.Processor

Finer points on Java Annotations API
- defined using @interface signature
- no modifiers required for defined methods
- can have a default values
- methods defined should not have parameters
- return values are always primitives including String and Arrays of primitives
- Annotation processor needs to implement javax.annotations.processing.Processor interface or java.annotations.processing.AbstractProcessor abstract class
- Java 6 and above compilers will look at META-INF/services/javax.annotation.processing.Processor file to look for annotation processors
