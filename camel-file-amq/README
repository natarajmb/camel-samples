This sample demonstrates how to read a csv file from the filesystem and transform it to JMS message.

To run the sample, check the file endpoint settings in spring-application-context.xml

Step1:
Copy the file PRODUCTS.CSV from /src/main/resources folder into the updated file endpoint folder.
Make sure you have ActiveMQ service started on port 27480. Copy files under /resource/activemq/ to
conf folder of ActiveMQ before starting.

Step2:
mvn camel:run

or to debug use following command

mvn clean compile exec:exec -Dexec.executable="java" -Dexec.args="-classpath %classpath -Xdebug
                -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8000 org.apache.camel.spring.Main"

To run the program. This sample uses a camel-maven-plugin which runs a bootstrap class in background and runs starts
the routes defined in provided context xml file.


Addition Steps:
If you want to see the full message on ActiveMQ console copy the camel-file-amq.jar file into
<ActiveMQ_Install_Folder>/lib and restart.
